# Product Catalog in React

[👉 View demo 👈](https://juanojeda.github.io/product-catalog/)

This uses `react` and `redux` to fetch a product feed (`json` format) and display a catalog, complete with filtering based on product size availability.

The project is developed with `gulp`, `webpack` and `browsersync` to make local development super smooth and 🏃speedy🏃. Javascript is passed through `babel` to enable the latest in futuristic ES6 syntactical 🍬sweetness🍬. Styles are written in `scss`. All code is linted, using `sass-lint` and `eslint` to maintain clean and ✨sparkly✨ code.

_(Don't worry, there are no emojis in my code.)_
